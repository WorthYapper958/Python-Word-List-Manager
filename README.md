# Python-Word-List-Manager
This script manages a word list in word_list.txt, ensuring it's alphabetically sorted and free of duplicates. It reports duplicates found and total unique words at startup. Users can add new words interactively, with automatic sorting and duplicate prevention. If the .txt file doesn't exist, it's created automatically.
